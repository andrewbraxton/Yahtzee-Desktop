# Proposal
For my final project I will create a desktop application for playing the dice game Yahtzee. The application will have a graphical interface, sound effects, and mouse/keyboard controls.

## Yahtzee
Description of the game, per Wikipedia:
>The objective of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations and dice must remain in the box. A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round the player chooses which scoring category is to be used for that round. Once a category has been used in the game, it cannot be used again. The scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others for which the score depends on the value of the dice. A Yahtzee is five-of-a-kind and scores 50 points, the highest of any category. The winner is the player who scores the most points.

## Possible features
Here are some of the features that could be included, subject to complexity and time restraints:

* Single and multiplayer modes
* Records of player statistics (games played, average score, high score leaderboard, etc.)
* AI player for a user to play against
* Training mode, where a user is informed of the expected value of their decision to roll/keep
* Achievements

## Library
The library I will use is the openFrameworks sound library for implementing sound effects. These will include sounds for dice rolls, button presses, and victory screens.
